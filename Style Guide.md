# MadaData Code Style Guide

## Naming

*It is very important to figure out names and make naming exact and consistent*

- use `logIn`, `logOut`, and `signUp`, and their snake_case accordingly.
  - do no use `login` unless it is used as a name (but prefer `credential` or `principle`)
  - do not use `signin` or `signout` or other variations
- use camelCase for acronyms, like `UserDao` and `graphQlSchema`, not `UserDAO` or `graphQLSchema`
